svg.transform
=============

It's a library to do svg.transforms.

It's been on a list of things to do for years, and I haven't implemented it,
because I don't need it, and making a library you don't use is silly.
But since nobody else is implementing this, even though it's perfectly simple,
well, I did it anyway. Anger-Driven Development is a thing. :-D

You are welcome.

I'm already looking for someone to take over this, and I haven't even started
writing code. You can take over svg.path too, I don't use it anymore either.
